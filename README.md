# twitter-wayback
it's just a simple query tool to get all tweets from a specific time span.

## Usage
In a running installation (e.g. on https://wayback.zweirat-stuttgart.de) just enter the twitter username, you'd like to get the information.\
There's an additional option to widen the time span from +/- one day to +/- three days and +/- one week. The default ist one day.

## Installation
Just publish the two files on any webserver and start the index.html\
It might be a good thing, to use a subdirectory for this tool, maybe you want to point a subdomain to this new subdirectory.
Please see the documentation of your hosting service, how to do such tasks. 

## UX
Of course, the UX urgently needs some TLC. It was just a quick "let's see if it works at all"-test.
Unfortunately it did and then I lost interest in the further development.
